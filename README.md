8 channel precision temperature logger with PT100/PT1000 sensors

This piece of equipment was created to make the measurement of PCBs in enclosures possible. The device consists of the base module and adapters. It is possible to connect the sensors in several ways:

    directly using screw terminals
    with long IDC cable. Length does not matter since the connectivity is with 4 wires
    with 4 FFC/FPC jumpers. Each jumper supports up to 2 sensors. Jumpers up to 61cm are available
    combination of IDC cable and FFC/FPC jumpers.

The main idea behind using the FFC/FPC jumpers is that they can be easily inserted using enclosure slots and do not affect the airflow.
